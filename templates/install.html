            <h2>Install</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, you can play the prealpha builds of the mod as they are updated on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, download the Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer. You can click <a href="steam://install/243750/">here</a> if you have Steam opened and it will start the download.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Once it's installed, you want to go to its Betas window, so right click on it on your library, select properties, and then Betas. You will need beta_test in order to play the mod.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Once it's installed, <a href="https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/releases/">you can get the latest release from here</a>. Download the file "momentum-&ltversion&gt.zip" and make sure to extract it inside Steam/Steamapps/sourcemods/
            </p>    
            <p>
                Finally, restart Steam and you should see Momentum Mod listed on your Steam library ready to be played! Remember that we are currently in Pre-Alpha state, and as such the current build is not reflective of final quality. We plan to add many more features before we release the mod!
            </p>
